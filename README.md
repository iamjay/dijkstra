This is a C# library for searching shortest path between nodes in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. There is also a demo app that take a json input and find the shortest path and render the graph using NodeXL library.

# How to build
The library can be built by using the solution file Dijkstra.sln. Make sure nuget restore is enabled.
